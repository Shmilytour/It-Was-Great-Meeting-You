    <h1>Babyyyyyy ❤️</h1>
    <p>Thank you, thank you so much for the gift of you in my life...</p>
    <p>[Honestly, I still can’t imagine where I’d be without you. You’ve made such a huge impact on my year, and on this last day of the year, I just want you to know how much I love and appreciate you for everything you’ve done for me. Life is so much easier with you around, and I need you to know I’ll never take that for granted.

Knowing there’s someone, somewhere, who feels like home and will always have my back, it’s a blessing I treasure deeply. I pray that everything works out for the best for us in 2025 (no pressure, of course). I hope we’re able to cross milestones together, do exciting things, and truly enjoy life without ever losing our smiles. I pray for the gift of a great friendship, a beautiful love relationship, and a future filled with joy.

You are my greatest blessing, my safe haven, and my forever. You’ve filled my life with warmth, joy, and a love I never thought possible.

As we step into a new year, I’m more grateful for you than ever. I promise to keep choosing you, over and over, every single day. My heart will always belong to you, now and forever. I sincerely and inexplicably love you so much.]</p>

    <p>With all my love,<br><strong>Oreoluwa ❤️</strong></p>
